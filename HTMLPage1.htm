<h1>
Making's doing doings living.
</h1>
    <h3>Paraphrase</h3>
        <p>People swing from left to right. Were at a hippy extreme. China wants islands, Iran wants necular bombs.
        Obama wants everyone to be peaceful. The wasp mentality is no good to hippys, the man is a wasp.
        Hippy's rebel aginst the man. And the cycle repeats itself. People will fall right back into the White
        Anglo American Saxon point of view when the time comes.</p> 

<h1>Making something new or taking something that exists</h1>
    <h3>
    Manfest of a new country with lots of capital
    </h3>
        <P>America has always been a land of acomplished people. We have always seemed to rise above and succeed turmoil.
        We made turmoil our bitch, and spit at it. Hardcore people, in a hardcore place was what we were. Now
        we are soft core people in a softcore place. There is always talk of being more accepting, and rewarding everyone
        so they get there fair share. I heard from <a href="http://www.libertyzone.com/Communist-Manifesto-Planks.html"> 
        Liberty Zone</a> that communisim is all about fair shares. Why wouldent it be. But my humble opinion is that
        there isnt a fair way to distribute shit shoveling. There isnt a fair way to distibute a honest days work. 
        There isnt a fair way to divi out a company. </p> 
        
<h1>Nuances</h1>       
    <h3>Changing the inflection of words.</h3>
        <p>The word liberal used to have a differnt nuance. Now it has the nuance of a socialist. Before he had a free almost 
        libertarian nuance. Changing the nuances of words is critical in todays culture. If you can make people think
        the nuance of white is bad. Or the nuance of slut is good, than you got something. nuances are ways for the brain 
        to determine one thing from the next. Things a nuance of lion is death. A nuance of ciggarates is cancer. So not all the 
        time they are bad, there a way for us to learn and pick up what to go to and stay away from. Like water is 
        good and life preserving. nuances are important. If somehow you could make water's nuance or inflection into something 
        negative almost deadly, one could prevent some from drinking it. If you make the American constituion's nuance "outdated" than
        people will want or be more willing to change it. </p>
